# Event Booker

## Hi! This is my exam project for Advanced JavaScript.

Iâ€™m building an event booking application from scratch that will cover:

- UX research & design â€“ planning user flows and wireframes before development.

- Full backend functionality â€“ built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, including authentication, data models, and a REST API.

- Frontend â€“ built with React, connected to the backend for browsing, booking, and managing events.

This project is still a work in progress â€“ Iâ€™ll be updating the repo as I go.

ðŸš€ Come back soon to see how Iâ€™ve been getting on and for the deployed version!

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ™Œ
