# Event Booker

## Hi! This is my exam project for Advanced JavaScript.

I‚Äôm building an event booking application from scratch that will cover:

- UX research & design ‚Äì planning user flows and wireframes before development.

- Full backend functionality ‚Äì built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, including authentication, data models, and a REST API.

- Frontend ‚Äì built with React, connected to the backend for browsing, booking, and managing events.

- Admin features ‚Äì approve/reject events, manage users, and view event statistics.

- Organiser workflow ‚Äì create and edit events, including handling admin feedback (‚Äúneeds update‚Äù) before events are approved.

This project is a work in progress ‚Äì I‚Äôll be updating the repo as I go.

üöÄ Check out the deployed version here: [Eventure Live](https://eventure-events.netlify.app/)

Thanks for dropping by! üôå
